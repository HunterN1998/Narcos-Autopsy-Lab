## Evidence - Recycle Bin Files (Volume 7)

The following images were recovered from the `$Recycle.Bin` directory on the Volume 7 basic data partition:

### 1. narcotics_photo_1.jpg
- Shows multiple clear baggies containing suspected narcotics
- Image format: JPEG
- Metadata: No embedded geolocation data; EXIF metadata shows no signs of manipulation

### 2. cash_evidence_1.jpg
- Depicts stacks of U.S. currency organized on a table
- Possibly connected to recent earnings (referenced in scenario briefing)

### 3. gang_vest_1.jpg
- Displays a logo consistent with known organized criminal groups
- May indicate affiliation with a larger network

### Additional Notes:
These files were **not securely deleted**. Basic recovery through Autopsyâ€™s GUI allowed full retrieval, making this a strong example of improper operational security by the user.
